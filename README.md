# CS231n | Assignments Solutions | Spring2020
 Stanford CS231n Course: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recogntion Assignments' Solutions.

The following repository has my solutions to all assignments of the CS231n Course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2020).

Assignments using PyTorch are only completed. TensorFlow related files are left unfinished.

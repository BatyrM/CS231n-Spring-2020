So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

PyTorch Module API\n","\n","Barebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n","\n","PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n","\n","To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n","\n","1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n","\n","2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n","\n","3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n","\n","After you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in part II.\n","\n","### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n","Here is a concrete example of a 2-layer fully connected network:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PdXXtCaQQcUA","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1591791219245,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":39613,"user":{"displayName":"Batyrbek Mukhatbekov","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gion0b7kLlPi_0IYTXbFfq-p-qLMFpTNgBBUWCy=s64","userId":"12482197744406652058"}},"outputId":"003a7144-aff2-4935-effd-4364b12c2730"},"source":["class TwoLayerFC(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        # assign layer objects to class attributes\n","        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n","        # nn.init package contains convenient initialization methods\n","        # http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch-nn-init \n","        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc1.weight)\n","        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n","        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc2.weight)\n","    \n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        # forward always defines connectivity\n","        x = flatten(x)\n","        scores = self.fc2(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))\n","        return scores\n","\n","def test_TwoLayerFC():\n","    input_size = 50\n","    x = torch.zeros((64, input_size), dtype=dtype)  # minibatch size 64, feature dimension 50\n","    model = TwoLayerFC(input_size, 42, 10)\n","    scores = model(x)\n","    print(scores.size())  # you should see [64, 10]\n","test_TwoLayerFC()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["torch.Size([64, 10])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2yQISptKQcUD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Module API: Three-Layer ConvNet\n","It's your turn to implement a 3-layer ConvNet followed by a fully connected layer.

Do your networks train faster?\n","- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n","    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n","- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n","\n","### Tips for training\n","For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!
